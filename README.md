# Client-Server Java Project

This project contains various Java classes that implement different client-server components, including services for scanning local ports and managing connections. Each component serves a specific function within a client-server architecture, focusing on establishing and managing server sockets, handling client requests, and ensuring efficient communication.

## Features

- **Local Port Scanning**: Scans local ports in a given range to check if they are open or closed, using a simple server socket approach.
- **Client-Server Communication**: Implementations of client-server communication models for handling requests and responses between clients and servers.
- **Multi-port Server Socket Management**: Ability to test and identify open ports within the local system.
